# Restaurant Simulator
### By Mattias Sebanc

### Project Proposal

**_Application Features:_**

###### In this application, users will be able to:
- Control amount of tables in the restaurant
- Check and set table status (such as clean, unclean, set, and occupied)
- Assign customers of varying sizes to unoccupied tables that fit the party size
- Take customers' orders and record when food/drinks was delivered
- Keep track of the bill with the correct amount needed to be paid

**_Users_**

###### This application will be used by:
- Restaurant Managers: to keep track of tables
- Restaurant Waiters: to keep track of customer orders

**_Interest_**

###### This application is of interest to me because:
- It has fascinated me how waiters are able to keep track of all the moving parts of a restaurant
- I wanted to code a program that would do exactly that, keep track of tables and customers
- I thought it would be interesting to combine a budget tracking program with a program that keeps track of items
- Because of the pandemic, I wanted to make a program that keeps track of cleaning status as that is relevant to the time

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to add tables of different sizes to my restaurant
- As a user, I want to remove tables of different sizes from my restaurant
- As a user, I want to check if the tables are clean/set and clean/set them if they are not
- As a user, I want to assign varying party sizes to the tables where they fit
- As a user, I want to take customers' drink and food orders when needed
- As a user, I want to record when the food and drinks were delivered 
- As a user, I want to keep track of the amount owed and when it was paid
